# Summer DS/ML Challenge 2025

Welcome to my **daily machine learning & data science challenge** for summer 2025.

Every day I build a new project — from data scraping to full-on ML pipelines — combining what I learn with stuff I actually care about like video games, geography, nature, and education.

The goal: **have fun, stay sharp, and build a portfolio.**

## Why This Exists

I’m leveling up for a future in **data science + machine learning** — and this repo tracks my journey from basic scripts to full-stack, intelligent applications.
