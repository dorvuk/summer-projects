# Summer DS/ML Challenge 2025

Welcome to my **daily machine learning & data science challenge** for summer 2025.

Every day I build a new project — from data scraping to full-on ML pipelines — combining what I learn with stuff I actually care about like video games, geography, nature, and education.

The goal: **have fun, stay sharp, and build a portfolio.**

## Projects

| Day | Title | Topics |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [Day 1](./day1_deltarune_popularity) | Deltarune Character Popularity | Web scraping, data normalization, visualization |
| [Day 2](./day2_gaming_world_stats) | Global Gaming Skill Index | API integration, data merging, geospatial visualization |

---

## Stack I'm Using (for now)

- Python (requests, pandas, matplotlib, GeoPandas)
- Public + authenticated game APIs (Chess.com, osu!, Faceit, Riot)
- Data normalization + merging across domains
- Geospatial visualization (Natural Earth shapefiles, mapclassify)
- Git + GitHub
- `.env`-based secret management

---

## Why This Exists

I’m leveling up for a future in **data science + machine learning** — and this repo tracks my journey from basic scripts to full-stack, intelligent applications.
